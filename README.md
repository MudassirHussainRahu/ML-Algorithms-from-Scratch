# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch using Python

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental **Machine Learning algorithms built from scratch** — without using high-level libraries like scikit-learn.  
It’s designed for learning, experimentation, and understanding **how ML algorithms actually work** behind the scenes.
